# Segmenting Shopping Mall Customers using Unsupervised Learning

Welcome to my first Python project on GitHun
In this project, I use **Unsupervised Learning** to segment mall custmoers based on Income and SpendingScore. The dataset also includes CustomerID, Gender, and Age and can be found using the link below.
