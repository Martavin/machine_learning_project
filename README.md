# Segmenting Shopping Mall Customers using Unsupervised Learning

Welcome to my first Python project on GitHub.
In this project, I use **Unsupervised Learning** to segment mall custmoers based on Income and SpendingScore. The dataset also includes CustomerID, Gender, and Age and can be found using the link below.

## Project Overview 

This project is a data science project that includes the full machine learning workflow:
- Data loading and exploration
- Data cleaning and Preprocessing
- K-means/Clustering
- Model Evaluation
- Vizualizations

  The goal is to segment customers based on Income and SpendingScore

  ## Skills Demonstrated

  - Data analysis using **Pandas**
  - Data visualization with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
  - Machine learning using **scikit-learn**
  - Bulding and Interprting a cluster using **Sklearn.cluster**
  - Writing clean and documented Python code

 ## Dataset
 The dataset used is called "mallcustomers.csv" It includes features such as:
 - 200 shopping mall customers
 - CustmomerID
 - Gender
 - Age
 - Income (Target variable)
 - SpendingScore (Target variable)
